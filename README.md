The company's cloud vendor has reported some concerning traffic in the IDS logs that they must review. They noticed many requests for links that do not appear to be part of my website. It is possible that a hacker used some type of scanning tool. They also saw an SSH (Secure Shell) connection from the same IP Address that was using some type of website scanning tool. SSH traffic is encrypted, so the technician reviewing the logs was not sure what was happening or if any malicious activity has occurred on the system. My CEO is extremely concerned about a ransomware attack and the impact on business operations. She told me that she does not want me to take the time to image the system and examine it, because time is of essence. She just wants me to go in an examine the system forensically and determine if the system has been compromised. She would like some evidence to be confident it is compromised and if that is the case, local and possibly federal law enforcement may be called to the scene due to some of the sensitive records and personal information on our site. My job is to carefully review the system and let her know if I feel, based on the forensic evidence, that the system has been compromised. She wants a video demonstration to show other stakeholders, law enforcement, and other contractors that may be brought in for remediation.
